1e Taak Becode - Markdown Warmup


## We chose the site [007Museum](007museum.com).

We've found the site searching google for : "most ugliest websites". We then found the site on another site that listed 
some of the most ugly sites on the internet (https://edit.co.uk/blog/top-10-worst-websites/). 

The last time this site was updated is **2017**. 

###Suggestions

*The first page is incredibly long, it definitely needs to be more concise. I suggest to start that we create a navigation outlet that lets you navigate to articles by date that you enter.
*Should make the website box fill the full screen not be a box
*Adjust font and heirarchy of text
*Make colors softer and create focus
*Make a navigation bar to organize sections of the website
*Splash page of website can have a stylish list of James Bonds superposing each other. This is an example image that we would have to work on in PS.
