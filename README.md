# Bad-Website-Review

1e Taak Becode - lelijke website
The first page is incredibly long, it definitely needs to be more concise. I suggest to start that we create a navigation outlet that lets you navigate to articles by date that you enter.
Should make the website box fill the full screen not be a box
Adjust font and heirarchy of text
Make colors softer and create focus
Make a navigation bar to organize sections of the website
Change font from hypertext font
