## We chose the site [007Museum](007museum.com).

We've found the site searching google for : **"most ugliest websites"**. We then found the site on another site that listed 
some of the most ugly sites on the internet (https://edit.co.uk/blog/top-10-worst-websites/). 

The last time this site was updated is **2017**. 

## Purpose
The site is used to accompany and advertise a museum in Sweden for the James Bond character from Ian Fleming's books and the following movies.

## Design
The website is one long collection of items the author may have found interesting, seemingly without prioritised order or categorisation, and without the use of layout options to guide the visitor through the content.

### Suggestions

* The first page is incredibly long, it definitely needs to be more concise. I suggest to start that we create a navigation outlet that lets you navigate to articles by date that you enter.
* Should make the website box fill the full screen not be a box
* Adjust font and heirarchy of text
* Make colors softer and create focus
* Make a navigation bar to organize sections of the website
* Splash page of website can have a stylish list of James Bonds superposing each other. This is an example image that we would have to work on in PS.
